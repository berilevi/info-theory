See [my layman's notes on entropy, compression and error correction]
(http://troydhanson.github.io/info-theory/Coding_and_Entropy.html).

Sample code. These are based on the three texts cited in my notes.

* [compute entropy on byte streams](/entropy).
* [Hamming codes for error correction](/hamming).
